title: About Me
---

My name is Carl Lieberman.
I wear many hats.

### Research

I am a graduate student in economics at Princeton University with interests in labor, public, and behavioral economics.
I have worked on topics such as the link between bereavement and creativity, alternative work arrangement valuations, and limited attention in the movie market.
I completed my undergraduate studies at Brandeis University and have previorsly worked as a senior research specialist in the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton.

### Computing

From a technical side, just about everything I do runs through [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
I do statistical computing in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Stata](http://www.stata.com/), general programming in [Java](http://openjdk.java.net/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), and write in [org](http://orgmode.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
I use GNU/Linux on the desktop, and my preferred distro is [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) for its flexibility and engineering.

### Personal

I watch a lot of baseball.
I play the guitar badly.
Louis from One Direction once complimented my beard.
