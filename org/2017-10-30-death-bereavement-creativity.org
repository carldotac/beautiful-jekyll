I am proud to announce that [[http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2850][Death, Bereavement, and Creativity]], coauthored with [[http://people.brandeis.edu/~kgraddy/][Kathryn Graddy]], is now available through the Articles in Advance series at Management Science.
The paper explores the link between its eponymous concepts, finding that despite the folk "wisdom" that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso%2527s_Blue_Period][artists do their best work while suffering]], the link seems to be negative.
Media coverage by The Independent on an earlier version of the paper is available [[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/painters-did-not-produce-best-work-when-suffering-emotional-turmoil-research-says-a6783706.html][here]].
On a personal note, this paper represents my first published research paper as an author.
