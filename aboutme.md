title: About Me
---

My name is Carl Lieberman.
I wear many hats.

I graduated from Brandeis University with a major in economics and math minor.
My senior thesis, "Aggregated Review Scores and Consumer Demand for Experience Goods: A Case Study in the Motion Picture Industry," looked at whether [Rotten Tomatoes](https://rottentomatoes.com) influenced demand for movies.
I have also worked on research relating to bereavement and creativity, eligibility monitoring for Medicaid and CHIP, and alternative working arrangements.
Currently, I work as a senior research specialist in the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton University.

From a technical side, just about everything I do runs through Emacs for its extensibility and fantastic support for the computational tools of the social scientist.
I do statistical computing in R and Stata, general programming in Java and Python, and write in org and LaTeX.
All of my machines run GNU/Linux, and my preferred distro is openSUSE thanks to its flexibility and balance of new features with stability.

I watch a lot of baseball.
I play the guitar badly.
Louis from One Direction once complimented my beard.
